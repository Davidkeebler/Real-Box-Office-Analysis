    "# Real Box Office Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes a set of real box office data (provided by flatiron data science school) which includes information gathered from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, ThemovieDB, and The Numbers in order to provide business insights for the investors looking to open a new movie studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data explaination\n",
    "\n",
    "The data files used for the analysis are not included within this repository in order to reflect industry best practicies and to simulate the process I would follow if I were working with private and sensitive data. The zipped data can be obtained at the flatiron school repository which served as a model example for this project, accessible [here.](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-2-project-v3/tree/gating/zippedData)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to create actionable, data-based reccommendations that the investors in a new movie studio can follow in order to maximize the success of their new films. For the purpose of this analysis, I am considering 'success' to be the profitability an degree of profitability of the movie; not just positive user ratings. In my exploratory analysis of the data, I found that there was a correlation between the budget of the movie and the user ratings the movie recieved, and I additionally found a correlation between user ratings and the total profit of the movie. I also found the number of total foreign markets a movie was released in to be a strong predictor of the movie's profit. Finally, I found that the original language the movie was produced in to be another strong predictor of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Assembly and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "In my exploratory analysis, I found that out of the five sources of data I have assembled for the project, only three of them were well suited to my analysis. The Box Office Mojo data is an inferior version of the data from The Numbers, and joining the Rotten Tomatoes data with everything else would result in a huge amount of lost entries/NaN values, meaning it was not feasible to include it. In the cells below, I assemble the data into a single dataframe and clean out the missing and placeholder values from the columns I plan to use in my analysis."

The IMDB database is rather large, but due to the reliance of my analysis on profit as a metric of success, I can only use records that overlap with the data from The Numbers, which is a rather small amount. Regardless, due to the relatively small number of movies that come out each year, this amount of data should be sufficient for this analysis, and later in my analysis I use statistical tests to confirm that this is the case."
