# Real-Box-Office-Analysis Exploration Branch
The purpose of this branch is to explore the features of the dataset I've chosen to work with and to determine which analytical insights I will seek to create with it.
I decided to not use the data from box office mojo, because it was essentially an inferior version of the data from The Numbers. I also decided not to involve the rotten tomatoes data in my analysis because it did not have unique information I thought would be valuable to my analysis and the method I had come up with to join it with the other data would have resulted in the loss of the majority of the records.
This exploratory analysis of the data found evidence of correlation between the budget of the movie, aggregate ratings, and total profit. It also found evidence of correlation between the number of markets that each movie was released in and the total profit of the movie. Finally, I was also able to do a basic analysis with a small sample size which indicated that the Hindi speaking movie market is the most lucrative.
I also found a lack of correlation between the runtime of individual movies and their profit.
The work I did in this branch is essentially the majority of the work I had to do for this project. Now that I know exactly which data I am going to load and the analysis that I want to do, I can keep my main branch notebook clean and only load/clean exactly the data that I need. It also allows me to go straight to the analysis I want to do in the main branch insteawd of exploring different options and explaining my process there.
The only concern I am still left with for the main branch is the small sample size I am working with for foreign markets, but I don't think I will be able to expand my sample size of movies released in foreign markets without doing additional webscraping. The main limitation on that analysis is the lack of production budget and gross profit numbers for those movies - the records of movies being released in foreign markets exist in the IMDB data, but the BOM and TN datasets which contain the financial numbers are rather limited in size.
